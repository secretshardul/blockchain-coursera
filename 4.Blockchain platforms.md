# Hyperledger Fabric
A permissioned blockchain project by Hyperledger.
1. Supports chaincode(like smart contracts) and not cryptocurrency.
2. Supports multiple algorithms like proof of work, round robin or **practical Byzantine fault tolerance(PBFT)**.
3. It has different types of nodes
    1. Endorsers: Validate and sign transactions transactions and return them to the creating application.
    2. Ordering service: Collect signed transactions, sort them and send them to commiting peers.
    3. Commiting peers: Recieve blocks, validate their integrity and commit them to ledger.
4. **Assets**: Tangible items of value transacted in the blockchain. Eg. food supplies, financial assets. They're represented in ```<key, value>``` pairs.
5. **Chaincode**: Defines assets and provides functions to operate on them.
6. **Channels**: Permissioned networks on hyperledger. Each party of the consortium can have its separate channel. They can communicate with each other through **cross-chain chaincode**.
7. **Membership service provider**: Manages membership and roles
