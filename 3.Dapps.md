# Intro
Distributed apps(Dapps) are web/mobile apps which make use of decentralized compute such as Ethereum's smart contracts. Only core logic resides in smart contracts whereas bulk of the heavy lifting is done off-chain.

# Tools used
1. Truffle: IDE and CLI for Dapp development.
2. Ganache: GUI to deploy local ethereum blockchain.
3. Metamask: Wallet which can connect to local blockchain.
4. **Provable**: Special smart contract to access external resources from a smart contract. It was earlier named **Oraclize**.

# Truffle IDE
Node.js IDE for end to end Dapp development.
```sh
npx truffle init
npx truffle compile #develop build files
npx truffle migrate #deploy on chain
```
