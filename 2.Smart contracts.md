# Basics
1. Smart contracts were theorized by Nick Sabzo in  19 and implemented by Ethereum.
2. They're written in Solidity language for ethereum.
3. Solidity code compilation gives following artifacts:
    1. Name of smart contract
    2. **Metadata**: language, compiler etc
    3. **Bytecode**: Constructor and initialization code. It's not needed later so its not stored.
    4. **Runtime Bytecode**: Rest of the code which is stored at the address.
    5. **Application binary interface(ABI)**: A window to invoke contracts and get data back.
    6. **Gas estimates**
4. Contract address is a hash of creator's address and a nonce.

# Solidity
Solidity language consists of:
1. State variables/data
2. Functions: They are of many types
    1. Constructors
    2. Fallback function: Called when a function call fails. There can only be 1 such function  per contract. It cannot have arguments and return values. It must have external visiblity.
    3. View function
    4. Pure function: No state change. Eg. math functions
    5. Public
    7. Internal/private: Can only be accessed from current or derived contract.
    8. External: Can be accessed only externally and not by the contract.

## Syntax
```sol
function name(parameters) visibilityModifier accessModifiers returns (returnParameters)
{}
```

## Advanced features
1. **Modifiers**: Apply conditions which must be satisfied before function is executed.
2. **Exception handling**: ```assert()``` and ```require()``` throw exceptions and prevent state change if some condition holds true.
3. **Events**: Events are used to communicate with clients. Events are pushed to event subscribers on the client side. On other hand functions make pull requests. It is comparable to logging.

    Syntax
    ```
    event eventName(parameters);
    ```
4. **Keywords**:
    1. **Storage**: Data gets stored and changes contract state. It is more expensive.
    2. **Memory**: It is transient. Cheaper than storage in terms of gas.
5. **Self-destruct**: Contract destroys itself and can't be revived.
